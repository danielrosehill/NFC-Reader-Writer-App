# Copying tags

Functionality:

A copying tab interface which behaves like this:

Read functionality:

Same functionality as on the read tag tab.

Once a valid URL is detected the user has the ability to copy it.

The copying functionality allows for sequential copying up to 10 times (ie, the original tag can be copied up to 10 times).

The writing functionality on the tag copying tab functions exactly as it does on the main write tag tab: ie, by default each tag is both written and locked.
